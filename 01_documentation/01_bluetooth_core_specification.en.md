# {{ page.title }}

Bluetooth is a communication technology that is documented in the _Bluetooth Core Specification_ that standardizes it.

This document is maintained by the _Bluetooth Special Interest Group, Inc._ or _Bluetooth SIG_, a private association of companies interested in the technology. The members of this group are responsible for the development of Bluetooth.

As the technology evolves, the _Bluetooth SIG_ publishes new versions of the _Bluetooth Core Specification_ in the [specifications section of SIG's website](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/?types=specs-docs&keyword=core+specification&filter=). It should be noted that these specifications have a _Status_ indicating whether that specification is fit for use or already obsolete.

The specification, in its various versions, contains all the necessary information about the protocol to develop a device that can interoperate with other Bluetooth devices. This includes information about physical transport, the lowest layers of the protocol, up to the transport of application-level data. For this reason, it is a very extensive and rather complex specification.

Often, in this methodology, you will find references to the _Bluetooth Core Specification_ document where you can find more detailed information on the referenced topics.


## Other Bluetooth SIG documents

Besides the core protocol specification, the _SIG_ also publishes other documents of interest such as the [Bluetooth Assigned Numbers](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/?types=specs-docs&keyword=assigned+numbers&filter=) where numerical values and constants used in Bluetooth are listed, such as manufacturer identifiers or constants for the identification of Bluetooth versions.

The [GATT Specification Supplement](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/?types=specs-docs&keyword=GATT+Specification+Supplement&filter=) is also of special interest, as it contains all the definitions of the _GATT characteristics_ and other descriptors of Bluetooth services.

Additional learning materials provided by the *SIG* include:
- [An Introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy Development](https://www.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-resources/bluetooth-le-developer-starter-kit/) is a self-study educational resource that covers theory and practice for Bluetooth Low Energy GAP and GATT application development.
- [Designing and Developing Bluetooth Internet Gateway](https://www.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-resources/bluetooth-internet-gateways/?utm_campaign=developer&utm_source=internal&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=the-bluetooth-internet-gateway-study-guide) is also self-study educational material intended for software developers and technical architects, which focuses on Bluetooth internet gateways; middleware for interfacing BLE devices with the internet.  Note: Intended as a key component of any Internet of Things (IoT) architecture implementing Bluetooth technology.
- [Bluetooth Technology for Linux Developers](https://www.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-resources/bluetooth-for-linux/) is another self-study resource for Linux developers which explains the architecture of Bluetooth applications implementing use of the D-Bus and BlueZ protocol stack.
